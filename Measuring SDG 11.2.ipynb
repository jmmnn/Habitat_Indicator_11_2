    "## About this project\n",
    "\n",
    "> One of the internationally agreed indicators for this goal is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"11.2.1  Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age and persons with disabilities\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Location of public transportation routes and stops\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population within 0.5 km from each stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mobile telephone data provide by a mobile operator. It shuold be anonymized e.g. should not include telephone number or any individually identifiable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy research question\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we use mobile telephone data for estimating the location of public-transportation \"stops\" as well as the population living within a 0.5 km radious?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### New data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map bus routes and stops with cellular data: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.technologyreview.com/s/514211/african-bus-routes-redrawn-using-cell-phone-data/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map Population density based on cellular data:\n",

    "http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/15888.full\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datsources used for validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bus route map obtained through GPS given to passengers in buses:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.digitalmatatus.com/intro_lite.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population density would be validated against the previous census.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "The outcome of the project is intended to be a documented methodology and open source code to compute this SDG indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the methodology will continue to be refined and further developed for other indicators in an open and collaborative manner by academia, private sector, governments and the open source community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of this methodology\n",
    "This methodology currently does not fully address disaggregation of data eg. women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Milestone 1: Project Sign off:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inform management of the outcome of the workshop\n",
    "- Formulate a proposal paper (validate the approach, including a business case)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parners:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data partners: Mobile companies\n",
    "- Data experts: Global Pulse\n",
